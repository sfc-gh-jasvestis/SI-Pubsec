### Single-Command Setup
```sql
-- Run the complete setup script (5-10 minutes)
-- Creates everything: database, data, external sources, semantic models
@complete_demo_setup.sql
```

### Reset Environment (if needed)
```sql
-- Clean slate for fresh demo
@demo_reset.sql
@complete_demo_setup.sql
```

### Upload Semantic Models
```sql
-- Upload YAML files to Snowflake stage
PUT file:///path/to/semantic_models/*.yaml @SNOWFLAKE_PUBSEC_DEMO.SEMANTIC_MODELS.ANALYST_STAGE;

-- Create semantic models from uploaded files
CREATE SEMANTIC MODEL SNOWFLAKE_PUBSEC_DEMO.SEMANTIC_MODELS.CITIZEN_SERVICES_MODEL 
FROM '@SNOWFLAKE_PUBSEC_DEMO.SEMANTIC_MODELS.ANALYST_STAGE/citizen_services_model.yaml';

CREATE SEMANTIC MODEL SNOWFLAKE_PUBSEC_DEMO.SEMANTIC_MODELS.POLICY_IMPACT_MODEL 
FROM '@SNOWFLAKE_PUBSEC_DEMO.SEMANTIC_MODELS.ANALYST_STAGE/policy_impact_model.yaml';

CREATE SEMANTIC MODEL SNOWFLAKE_PUBSEC_DEMO.SEMANTIC_MODELS.SERVICE_PERFORMANCE_MODEL 
FROM '@SNOWFLAKE_PUBSEC_DEMO.SEMANTIC_MODELS.ANALYST_STAGE/service_performance_model.yaml';

CREATE SEMANTIC MODEL SNOWFLAKE_PUBSEC_DEMO.SEMANTIC_MODELS.WEATHER_SERVICE_CORRELATION_MODEL 
FROM '@SNOWFLAKE_PUBSEC_DEMO.SEMANTIC_MODELS.ANALYST_STAGE/weather_service_correlation_model.yaml';
```
