### üìä **Three Semantic Models Created**

#### 1. **Citizen Services Analytics Model**
- **Purpose:** Analyze citizen interactions with government services
- **Key Metrics:** Success rates, satisfaction scores, response times
- **Dimensions:** Age groups, districts, languages, service types, channels
- **Verified Queries (5 pre-tested):**
  - "How did our digital services perform over the weekend compared to weekdays?"
  - "Show me how senior citizens are using our digital services compared to other age groups"
  - "Which postal districts have the highest citizen satisfaction with government services?"
  - "Compare mobile app usage vs web portal usage across different demographics"
  - "When do citizens most frequently access government services?"

#### 2. **Policy Impact Analytics Model**
- **Purpose:** Measure effectiveness of government policies
- **Key Metrics:** Impact percentages, ROI, baseline vs current performance
- **Dimensions:** Policy names, target demographics, implementation dates
- **Verified Queries (5 pre-tested):**
  - "What's the ROI of our Digital Inclusion Initiative for seniors?"
  - "Which government policies have been most successful this year?"
  - "Show me the timeline of policy implementations and their impact over time"
  - "Compare policy effectiveness across different target demographics"
  - "How do digital policies compare to traditional policies in terms of impact?"

#### 3. **Service Performance Analytics Model**
- **Purpose:** Monitor government service performance against benchmarks
- **Key Metrics:** Response times, benchmark achievement, service volumes
- **Dimensions:** Services, agencies, metric types, performance categories
- **Verified Queries (6 pre-tested):**
  - "Which government services are meeting their performance benchmarks?"
  - "How is SingPass performing across different metrics?"
  - "Compare performance across all government agencies"
  - "Show me response time trends across different service categories"
  - "Which services are consistently underperforming and need attention?"
  - "How do government services perform on weekends compared to weekdays?"

### üé≠ **Enhanced Demo Scenarios with Cortex Analyst**

#### **Scenario 1: Real-Time Performance with Auto-Charts**

- **Generates interactive visualizations** showing weekend vs weekday performance
- **Creates heat maps** revealing peak usage patterns
- **Provides statistical insights** like "Weekend response times are 23% higher than weekday average"

#### **Scenario 2: Policy Impact with Visual Storytelling**
**Query:** *"Show me the Digital Inclusion Initiative impact with before/after charts"*

**Cortex Analyst Response:**
- **Creates comparison dashboards** with before/after metrics
- **Generates timeline visualizations** showing improvement trajectories
- **Builds ROI calculators** with real-time cost savings
- **Provides trend analysis** with confidence intervals

#### **Scenario 3: Service Benchmarking with Performance Dashboards**
**Query:** *"Which agencies are meeting their service benchmarks with visual comparisons?"*

**Cortex Analyst Response:**
- **Creates performance scorecards** for each agency
- **Generates benchmark comparison charts** with traffic light indicators
- **Builds drill-down capabilities** to explore specific services
- **Provides improvement recommendations** based on data patterns

### üîß **Setup Instructions**

#### **Step 1: Run Cortex Analyst Setup**
```sql
-- Execute cortex_analyst_setup.sql
-- This creates the necessary views and schema structure
```

#### **Step 2: Upload Semantic Models**
```sql
-- Upload the YAML files to Snowflake stage
PUT file://semantic_models/citizen_services_model.yaml @SG_PUBSEC_DEMO.SEMANTIC_MODELS.ANALYST_STAGE;
PUT file://semantic_models/policy_impact_model.yaml @SG_PUBSEC_DEMO.SEMANTIC_MODELS.ANALYST_STAGE;
PUT file://semantic_models/service_performance_model.yaml @SG_PUBSEC_DEMO.SEMANTIC_MODELS.ANALYST_STAGE;
```

#### **Step 3: Create Cortex Analyst Services**
```sql
-- Create semantic models in Snowflake
CREATE CORTEX ANALYST SG_CITIZEN_SERVICES_ANALYST 
USING '@SG_PUBSEC_DEMO.SEMANTIC_MODELS.ANALYST_STAGE/citizen_services_model.yaml';

CREATE CORTEX ANALYST SG_POLICY_IMPACT_ANALYST 
USING '@SG_PUBSEC_DEMO.SEMANTIC_MODELS.ANALYST_STAGE/policy_impact_model.yaml';

CREATE CORTEX ANALYST SG_SERVICE_PERFORMANCE_ANALYST
